A shell script to check and log when your internet connection goes down, by [@TristanBrotherton](https://github.com/TristanBrotherton) ‚Äì [Find his project here](https://github.com/TristanBrotherton/netcheck)  
**Now this script runs in a Docker container.**

---

## üìã What it does

This container runs a shell script that:

- Checks your internet connection every 5 seconds (via `ping` to `google.com`)
- Logs connection losses and recoveries with timestamps
- Optionally performs speed tests at startup and after each reconnect
- Serves a basic web interface showing log output via a lightweight Python web server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r00xat/netcheck-docker.git
cd netcheck-docker
docker build -t netcheck:own .
